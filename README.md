# MotorTicDetector

Tic disorders are characterized by involuntary, repetitive movements and/or vocalizations that can lead to persistent disability and impairment across the lifespan.
Proper diagnosis of tic disorder symptoms require intense human behavior monitoring by trained clinicians that can enhance subjectivity due to the lack of
quantitative measurement methods like tic frequency. As a step toward creating automated, objective, and quantitative assays of movement disorders, we propose a
computational framework to automate the detection of facial motor tics including eye tics, the most common type of tics experienced by patients.
The current study aimed to train a deep learning model on a publicly available video dataset of individuals with motor tics to quantify the frequency of the detected symptoms.
Videos from N = 42 individuals were coded by human raters using established methods. Researchers used a supervised learning approach to train a binary classifier to
detect motor tics. After filtering 11 videos out of the initial dataset, the coded dataset included 6089 images extracted from N = 31 videos. The classifier demonstrated
an accuracy (agreement with human coder) of 86.87% with a Sensitivity of 86.79% and Specificity of 86.95%. This preliminary study suggests that computer vision methods hold
promise for automating the detection of motor tics.
